# The while loops repeat while something is true for example.
num = int(input("Input a number: "))

while num <10:
    print(num)
    num = num + 1
print("The loop is done")
# This will print out the number until it reaches 10.
# The loop is done will print out after the loop is done.
# This is a simple example of a while loop.
